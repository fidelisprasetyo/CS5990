           #--> add your Python code here

       #find the average accuracy of this model during the 10 runs (training and test set)
       #--> add your Python code here

    #print the accuracy of this model during the 10 runs (training and test set).
    #your output should be something like that: final accuracy when training on cheat_training_1.csv: 0.2
    #--> add your Python code here
